<h2 id="the-content-of-the-tables">The content of the tables</h2>
<p>In the next two tables, the columns have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data set</strong> gives the data set name.</li>
<li><strong>used/total</strong> displays the number of 'good' transients over the total number of transients.</li>
<li><strong>setting</strong> is the [Fura] concentration choice (among 'min', 'mean' and 'max') that yielded the best straight line fit.</li>
<li><strong>RSS</strong> is the residual sum of squares of the best fit (its magnitude depends on the number of 'good' transients in the dataset).</li>
<li><strong>Prob</strong> is the probability for the RSS to <em>exceed</em> the observed value under the null hypothesis.</li>
<li><strong>99% CI</strong> is the 99% confidence interval for the endogenous kappa (kappa_s) obtained with a bootstrap simulation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> if the data set yieleded less than 3 'good' transients, no straight line fit was performed (it would have been meaningless) and 'NA' (Not Available) appears in the last 4 columns of the table.</p>
